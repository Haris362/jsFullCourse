While Do loop:-
            While do loop is used to perform any task repeatedly.it is used to perform the task in less time.
            We can use individually while loop and use the both while and do loop.In (do) write the code and
            condition is written inside the (while).And when we are using the while loop individually both 
            code and condition is written inside it.While is rarely used wostly other loops like
            (for,foreach etc) is used.
            Syntax:-
                    while (condition){
                        //code
                    }

                    do {
                        //code
                    }
                    while (condition);
