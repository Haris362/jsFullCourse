And opreator:-
            And is a logical opreator and opreator is work when all conditions are true if all 
            conditions are true then its will work and if any one condition is become false its
            not work.And opreator is working on boolean values which are true/false and is denoted
            by (.) which is used for multiplication.So when we convert the boolean values into number
            it give us 1 for true and 0 for false when all condtions are true so it is looking like 
            this(1.1.1.1 = 1).If any one condition is become false the answer is false which is zero
            (1.1.0.1 = 0)
            Syntax:-    
                    Condition-1 && Condition-2

Or opreator:-
            Or opreator is a logical opreator or opreator is working when one condition is true.
            Or is denoted by (+) in or opreator all outputs are adding.When all values are true 
            it is still working and if only one value is true it is still working but all values are
            become zero it is not work becuse (0+0+0+0 = 0 which is false)
            Syntax:-    
                    Condition-1 || Condition-2

Not opreator:-
            Not opreator is make the input opposite for example we are getting true output from user 
            and use not opreator with it change true into false.
            Syntax:-    
                    !Condition-1
