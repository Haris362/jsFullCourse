Ternary opreator:-
                This opreator is denoted by (?) it is the short form of the if else.By using this opreator
                we can easily handle the multiple condition.Ternary opreator is used to make a code clean 
                becuase when we are using the if else the code is become very longer.
                Syntax:
                       condition ? expression1 : expression2 
                       condition ? doThisIfTrue :doThisIfFalse;

Nullish Coalescing opreator:-
                 This opreator is very useful when we are getting data from data base.It is denoted by
                 (??) it is used to check whether the value is null in variable or data which is getting
                 from the data base.If value is null it returns the value after the opreator mean returns
                 default value.
                 Syntax:
                     variableName ?? expression...
