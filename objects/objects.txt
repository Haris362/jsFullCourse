Objects:-
        Objects are used to store multiple values with their keys and values in it.
We can create objects by two methods:-
1.Object which is make using constructor is called singleton.Here,constructor is "new".
Syntax:
        const obj = new Object();
        Add values in singleton object by this method:
        
        name_Of_Obj.keys = "Which thing you want to add"
        obj.name = "Albert";

2.Object which is made up of curly brackets {} is called literals.
Syntax:        
        const obj2 = {};
        const obj3 = {
            key:"Add any thing you want"
        }
We know that wecan merge multiple array in one array.Same as we can merge the multiple objects in one
objects.
1.By using assign:-
            const mergeObjects = Object.assign(obj1,obj2);
2.by using spread (...):-
            const mergeObjects2 = {...obj1,...obj2};
