Data types are very interesting in the js.Because when we are changing the data type into another data type
some new features are added in it.For Example:when we are changing the number(which is primitive data type)
into non-primitive data type this changing make a number into object which give us more functions which can
make changes in the values by using the available functions of objects.we can change the numbers into the
objects using word "new" and use the data type you want and store value in it.
                const score = new Number(120)

Similarly when we are changing the string into the Non-primitive data type means in objects.Objects give us
some functions which helpus for our for make changes and seen the nature of the value.
                const name = new String("Haris")

Bonus Tips:-
1.There is some confusion in the conditional operations of the js because the (=) single equal to give a 
value and two equals to(==) compare the two things only and three equals to (===) comapre the values and
check their data types.
