                DOM means (Document Object Model) DOM used by js to make changes like on click on 
                button changes the colour and get the value.Basically DOM is used by js to add changes
                and add new things.
                Here,

                    Model means = Structure or map in which the code is persent.

(a):Changes make by js using DOM:-
In HTML elements are present in parent and child.Child present inside the parent.We can get the all child
elements that are present inside the parent.

Syntax to get elements in parents:- 
const element = document.getElementById('id-of-element')
console.log(element.children)
                             
(b):Methods to select the html elements in js:-
1.getElementById('idOfElement'):-
            This is used to get the element present in the html file by id.                        
            Syntax:-
                    document.getElementById('elementId')    
2.getElementByClassName('classOfElement'):-
            this is similar to the (getElementById) but in this method give class name.
            Syntax:-
                    document.getElementByClassName('elementClass')    

3.querrySelector():-
            querrySelector is the one of the most popular html elements selector because its get element
            by their tag name,class,id.But when we are getting the element by class before its class 
            use(.) and when we are getting element using id place (#) before the id.
            querySelector the one element and first element which is present inside the html code.
            Syntax:-
                    document.querrySelector('your choice how you want to get element by class id or tag name')

4.querrySelectorAll():-
            Its function is similar to the querrySelector only one change is that its select all elements
            that are present inside the parent.
            Syntax:-
                    element/document.querrySelector("your choice)
5.Select parents child;
            We can get the all childs present in the parent.and get parent element using child.
            Syntax:-
                    const parent = document.createElement("div")
                    console.log(parent.children)//Getting childs using parent element.

                    console.log(child.parentElement)//Getting parent using child

                createElement() it is used to createElement with their names in paranthesis(like div).And 
                secondly add the element by using appendChild() this is usedto add element 
                in the element used before it.
                Syntax:-
                        const div = document.createElement("div");
                        document.body.appendChild(div)
