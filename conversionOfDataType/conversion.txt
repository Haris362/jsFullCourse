>>Explaination about first conversion of string into number 
First we are initiallize the variable with score name and pass it value in string "33abs" which is
not only a number there is some alphabets in it.So,thats why when we change its datatype in second variable
and we console it give us NaN in output which means (Not a Number).

>>Explaination about conversion of boolean into number
First we are initiallize the variable with (confirmation) name and give it value true which is boolean
data type and in second step we are again initiallize the variable with name (confirmationInNumber)
in this step we are changing the data type of confirmation value by using (Number) data type.
Its give us output "1" becuase in confirmation variable we give it value true and the value of true in 
number is 1.

String interesting functions:-
if we are adding and subtracting multiple values and use string value in it then we face some problem i.e
1.If we use the string number first in solving the problem then it is treatable as a string. 
2.If we use the string number in the end in solving the problem then it is treatable as a number not as a string.
