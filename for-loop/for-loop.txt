For loop:-
        A for loop is used when you want to repeat your code more times.Basically it is used to iterate the 
        code.In for loop first step is to initiallize the variable and second step is to give the condition
        and the last step is your choice you want to increase/decrease.For loop have break and continue 
        feature.Break is helpful to stop the iteration and continue is used to skip the entire value and go
        to the next step.
        Example of for loop:- You want to print your name 100 time you write (console.log) 100 times which is
        very time consuming.Instead of write the code 100 times you can use for loop.
        Syntax:-
                Normal for loop syntax
                for (initiallization,condition,increment/decrement){
                    //Code
                }
                For loop syntax with break
                for (initiallization,condition,increment/decrement){
                    //code
                    break;
                }
                For loop syntax with continue
                for (initiallization,condition,increment/decrement){
                    //code
                    continue;
                }
