>> Variables:-
Variables are like a container or box in which we can store any thing in it for example:-we have a box
which is full of some fruits so we can say it a variable. 
There are three to four methods to create variables in javaScript.these all are given below with detail:-

1.Var method:-
            Var is the first method to create a variable which is used in ancient times in js.It is used
            in these days but it is not reliable becuase when we initiallize the variable one time with
            any word and again we give it the new value the new value is stored in the previous variable
            which is not appropriate.
            Syntax:
                var nameofvariable = "What ever you want to store in it is it number or string this is your choice"

2.Let method:- 
            Let is the second method to create a variable which is Block scope it is not changable and not
            re-initiallized.This is the best method to create a variable.
            Syntax:
                let nameofvariable = "What ever you want to store in it is it number or string this is your choice"

3.Const method:-
            Const is the third method utillize to create a variable which have constant value and it is 
            block scope variable which is not re-initiallized. 
            Syntax:
                const nameofvariable = "What ever you want to store in it is it number or string this is your choice"

4.Direct method:-
            In direct method we are not using let,var and const we can directly initiallize the variable likethis.
            nameofvariable = "What ever you want to store in it is it number or string this is your choice"
