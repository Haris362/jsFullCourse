Functions:-
        Function is a block of code which is used to perform any task.function is helpful when we are using
        the one value repeatedly. how we can use functions and get its value? where you want to get value 
        from function call the function by its name and use paranthesis at the end of the function.
        In,Functions we can use parameters and arguments.Parameters are like a variable which can store 
        value.Arguments are those value which are stored in the parameter.
        For example:-
        1.Assume that machine is a function.
        2.Parameter is a knob of machine which can change the values.
        3.Arguments are values which are set by the knob of machine.
        Syntax:-
                function myFunction(num1,num2){
                       return num1+num2 
                }
                myFunction(2,34)

In,functions some amazing things that is we can add elements of array and objects in functions.
