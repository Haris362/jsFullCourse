Synchronous:-
            Synchronous means code runs one line at a time in order and js is a single threaded it do
            one task at a time and not do the second task while the first line of code is not executed. 
            Example:-
                console.log(1);
                console.log(2);
                console.log(3);
            Here,1 is printed and then 2 is printed at the end 3 is printed.

Asynchronous:-
            Asynchronous is a code which is not stop the execution of code and doing work in the
            background.
            Example:-
                console.log(1);
                setTimeout(function(){
                     console.log(2)   
                },2000) 
                console.log(3);
            Here,first 1 is printed and at the second console we are using setTimeOut()which make delay
            on printing which is running at the background.In this delay time 3 is printed.

1.setTimeOut();-
            This is use to give delay.This is a asynchronous method because the code is executing
            and the delayed code is working in the background.This method is work one time.
            In setTimeOut gets 2 parameters :-
            1.function().
            2.Delay time.
            Syntax:-
                setTimeout (function(){})
2.setInterval():-
            Set interval is used to give delay on some code but set interval is do the task again and
            again.
            Syntax:-
                setInterval(function(){},time of delay)

3.clearTimeOut and interval():-
            Clear interval is used to stop the delay its gets some refrence.the refrence is the time
            apply on the element.
            Syntax:-
                    clearTimeInterval(refrence);
