Switch
       Switch is the short form of if else it is rearly used.In,worst case if else is used in conditions.
       Switch accept multiple condition and switch is not allow to use the opreator rather than
       strict equal to (===).We cannot write these strict equals in code it is automatically used in code.
       Syntax:
            switch (key(value on which you are apply conditions)){
                case "expression":
                //code
                break;

                default:
                //code
                break;
            }
       Here, in case line the expression is the value which is comparing you with your current value.
       break is used to stop the code here if condition satisfy.First case behave as a (if) and the other 
       cases after the first case behave as a (else if) and default is used as else.
